#summary FileVerifyHarness implementation

= Introduction =
Compare the contents of two files and verify they match.  Line separation characters are ignored (CR+LF / NL).  An optional list of allowed differences can be provided.

For instance if the expected file content is 'I have two pet cats' and the actual output is 'I have two pet dogs', this would not be considered a match; however, you could define an allowed exception of 'cat' and this would now be considered a match.
