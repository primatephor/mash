#summary Description of the SetupHarness interface

= Introduction =

The SetupHarness is used to prepare a script for running.  Multiple setup harness invocations are possible with each script.

See DevelopingHarnesses for information on harness development

= Details =

The setup harness interface is simple:

 * void setup() throws Exception

As with all other harnesses, it accepts 
 * Configurations (see ConfigurationDefinition)
 * Parameters (see ParameterDefinition)
 * has a list off errors (see HarnessError)

Extending the supplied base harness will provide most of this functionality, and the developer only needs to implement the setup() method.
