#summary FileWaitHarness implementation

= Introduction =

Watch the content of a specified path for files.  Default polling interval is every 5 seconds for a duration of 60 seconds.

= Configuration =

= Parameter =
 * 'path' = full path of the directory to watch.
 * 'size' = number of files to wait for.  Default value is 1
 * 'file_came' = name of the file to wait for.
 * 'file_contents' = list of strings that the found file must contain.
 * 'file_size' = The harness will wait until the combined size of all files in the path reaches this amount.

= Sample Usage =
== Case One ==
{{{
    <Run type="org.mash.harness.ftp.FileWaitHarness">        
        <Parameter name="path">
            <Value>mydirectory</Value>
        </Parameter>
        <Parameter name="size">
            <Value>3</Value>
        </Parameter>
    </Run>
}}}

Here the wait harness polls the directory using the default settings (every 5 seconds for 60 seconds), until there are 3 files present.
