#summary Description of the VerifyHarness interface

= Introduction =

The VerifyHarness verifies the state of invoked runs and setups.


= Details =

The verify harness interface:

 * {{{void verify(RunHarness run, List<SetupHarness> setup)}}}

As with all other harnesses, it accepts 
 * Configurations (see ConfigurationDefinition)
 * Parameters (see ParameterDefinition)
 * has a list off errors (see HarnessError)

Extending the supplied base harness will provide most of this functionality, and the developer only needs to implement the verify() method.

The verification should retrieve the response from the run, and pull together any necessary data from the harness or setup list to verify that the run is correct.
