#summary Description of the Configuration

= Introduction =

Configurations are used by harnesses to define base information that is required for a harness to run.


= Details =
Configurations accept the following data:
 * Value (just set a value)
 * Date (see DateDefinition)
 * Response (data from a previous setup)
 * Replace (search and replace information)

Most of these can be used together.  For example, you could use value and replace together, or reponse, replace, and date together.  This allows you to build interesting values by layering the information.  

The value of the Configuration is calculated in the following order
 * The value is used
 * The system property is used.  If a value is specified, it is appended after the system property.
 * The DateDefinition is used, any previous value is overridden
 * The file contents are used, any previous value is overridden
 * The content ReplaceDefinition is run
