MASH started as a system testing framework, and packaged with the code is all of the required libraries for running system tests 
with ant.

However MASH could also be used more as a general client invocation infrastructure. This is because aspects of invoking a client 
interface are encapsulated into a harness. The mash framework simply invokes the harness interfaces.
